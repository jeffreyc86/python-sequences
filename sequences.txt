A sequence is an ORDERED collection of items. Can refer to individual items by their index position.

Three basic types - lists, tuples, and ranges

All sequence types can be iterated over, which means they're also iterable types.

Lists are mutable and you CAN change the contents of a list.

Immutable objects can not be changed. The following immutable types are built into python:
- int
- float
- bool (True or False)
- str (string)
- tuple
- frozenset
- bytes
